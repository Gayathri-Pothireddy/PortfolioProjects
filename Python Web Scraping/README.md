# Wikipedia Largest Companies Web Scraping Project

## Overview

The Web Scraping Project is a Python script designed to extract information from a Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue. The script uses web scraping techniques to gather data from the specified URL, cleans and processes the data, and saves it into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script in a Python environment.

2. **View Output:**
   - The script fetches the HTML content from the Wikipedia page, extracts relevant tables, and displays the first 1000 characters for verification.
   - The project then identifies and extracts the desired table containing information about the largest companies.

3. **Explore Data:**
   - The script parses the table, cleans the data, and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame.
   - You can explore the top companies, their industries, revenue, and other relevant information.

4. **Save Results:**
   - The cleaned data is saved to a CSV file (`WebScraping_Output.csv`) for future use or analysis.
