# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

## Overview

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a simple Python script that calculates the BMI based on user-provided weight (in pounds) and height (in inches). The BMI is then categorized into different weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. The script provides personalized health recommendations based on the calculated BMI.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to offer users a quick and easy way to determine their BMI and gain insights into their weight status. The BMI is a widely used metric for assessing body weight in relation to height, and it helps individuals understand whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The provided health recommendations aim to encourage users to take actions towards better health.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the script by executing it in a Python environment.

    ```bash

3. **View BMI and Recommendations:**

## BMI Categories

The script categorizes BMI into the following weight status categories:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 – 24.9
- Overweight: 25 – 29.9
- Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

## Notes
